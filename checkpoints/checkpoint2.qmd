4. Once you are finished, upload the worksheet to Moodle in the checkpoint 2 assignment.

Your dataset may not have any categorical variables, or it may not have any numeric variables. If this is the case, just indicate so in the worksheet and then leave the remainder of that section blank. You will not lose credit if this is the case.
