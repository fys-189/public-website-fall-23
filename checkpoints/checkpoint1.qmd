## Introduction

The goal of this assignment is to get you started with Tableau. This data analysis in this assignment is admittedly pretty boring at least for me it is). ...but it's necessary to get some basic terminology and exposure to Tableau before we can do more interesting things with it.

### Part 2: Get Acquainted with Tableau

1.  Navigate to Tableau's [Getting Started](https://www.tableau.com/learn/tutorials/on-demand/getting-started?playlist=509087) Video Playlist.
2.  Enter information about Smith College in order to access the videos. You do not need to leave a personal phone number. Feel free to list my office phone number.
3.  Download `Sample - Superstore.xls` - an Excel file listed at the bottom of the page.
4.  Watch all videos (about 20 minutes), and follow along by recreating the dashboard shown in the video in Tableau Desktop. Note that you are working with the Desktop version of Tableau, not the Cloud version. The differences will be very minor, but just keep it in mind. Save the workbook.
5.  Once you are finished with both workbooks, export them from Tableau Desktop, and upload them to Moodle in the checkpoint 1 assignment.
