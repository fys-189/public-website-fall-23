# Individual vs. Aggregate Data

::: panel-tabset
### Individual

::: nonincremental
-   Every row refers to one case.
  - Details about one student
  - Reponses to one survey
- Variables describe something about that individual case
:::

### Aggregate

::: nonincremental
-  Rows summarize something across a series of cases.
  - Statistics about one county
  - Summaries of survey responses
- Variables summarize something across a series of cases (e.g. counts, averages, etc.)

## Filtering vs. Grouping

- Filtering **subsets** data
  - Narrows data down to only cases that meet a particular criteria
- Grouping data takes individual records and groups them according to common criteria
  - We often group by particular classifications (e.g. group data by sex, gender, race)
  - We can report totals, averages, differences etc. within each grouping
