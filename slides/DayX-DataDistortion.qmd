## Distortive Data Practices

- Social actions that result in the under/over/misrepresentation of data
- Not limited to just falsification or omission
- Often not just the result of "bad actors" but social systems that incentivize bad actions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# How is metric fixation an example of such an incentive?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## False Reporting

-   Lying or misreporting data
-   Auditing can be challenging

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Deceptive Accounting

-   Not technically false but deliberately misleading
-   Takes advantage of ambiguities in standards or laws
-   Often involves "creative" approaches to measurement or classification

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Discursive Risk 

-   Scope of dataset determined by definitions and reporting thresholds
-   Stakeholders have advocated for strengthening or loosening thresholds in line with certain political commitments

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Questions for Analyzing Distortive Practices

- How do social groups mobilize discourse to shape the contours of data infrastructures and delimit data production?
- What legal, financial, and institutional configurations enable and incentivize institutions to develop and engage distortive data practices?
- How is strategic accounting organized into ritualized practices?
- How do data producers navigate time and resource constraints, infrastructural shortcomings, ethical dilemmas, and conflicting demands in moments of data collection and aggregation?
