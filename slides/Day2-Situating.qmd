## A Common Viewpoint

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

- The more plain, the more neutral
- The less emotional, the more objective
- The more distance between humans and numbers, the more truthful and factual

# What are some of the things people do to make visualizations appear neutral?

---

# Why do the authors argue that neutral visualizations are actually persuasive?

# What does Donna Haraway mean when she refers to this as a 'God Trick'? Why is this feminist?

## Situated Knowledge and Standpoint Theory

- All knowledge is produced in a particular time, place, context, and from a particular body with particular history
- Our standpoints frame the knowledge that we produce
- We get closer to "strong objectivity" the more standpoints involved in knowledge production
- Objectivity is not about distancing humans but about diversifying knowledge production and making it more inclusive

# We can only see the world from particular standpoints. We can never see everything at once.

## How would standpoint theorists critique the idea that data collected by algorithms produce more objectivity than data collected by humans?

---

# How would standpoint theorists critique the idea that we should distance individual human perspectives from data?

## Exercise

- Imagine you are tasked with designing a dataset that represents how students in our class have experienced the impacts of Covid-19. 
- Write down three questions that you would present to students in the class.
- We want to be able to compare and draw summary statistics from responses, so be sure to write multiple choice questions and list the possible responses for those questions.

--- 

## Reflect

- What questions did you write down, and what were the possible options?
- Consider how your social identity (or your standpoint) might impact how you come up with the possible choices for that question.
