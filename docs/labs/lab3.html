<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this lab, you will work through a series of exercises to visualize data regarding racial inequities in maternal mortality rates in the United States. Specifically, you will practice producing both uni-variate and multi-variate column plots and line plots from aggregate data in Tableau.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-dataset" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-dataset">The Dataset</h2>
<p>Through the National Vital Statistics System, the US National Center for Health Statistics aggregates data about population health (including births, deaths, and pregnancies) from states in order to guide public health policy and decision-making. The Center for Disease Control makes this data available to the public through a series of public use files, along with an online data query interface called WONDER (Wide-ranging OnLine Data for Epidemiologic Research). Navigating to the WONDER interface, an analyst can access and download US mortality and population data, spanning the years from 1999 to 2019, aggregated at national, state, and county levels. With the data gathered from US death certificates, which report an individuals’ underlying cause of death according to the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases, the death counts can be disaggregated into hundreds of different causes of death. The death counts can also be disaggregated by a series of demographic variables, including gender, age, race, and Hispanic ethnicity.</p>
<p>By adjusting the query parameters on the WONDER request form to indicate how the CDC’s data should be aggregated and filtered, data analysts can produce a series of different rectangular datasets. For example, an analyst can opt to group the results by Year and Race and filter the Cause of Death to ICD-10 codes O00-O99 (Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium) to produce a dataset that tracks the death counts and crude death rate due to pregnancy-related causes for different racial demographics in the US from 1999 to 2021. Alternatively, an analyst could opt to group the results by State and Cause of Death and filter the data to 2021 to determine the leading causes of death in each state in that year.</p>

<li><a href="../data/race_year_pregnancy.txt">race_year_pregnancy.txt</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Open Tableau, and create a new workbook called <code>cdc_maternal_deaths</code>. Click “Connect to Data” and the <code>race_age_pregnancy_2020.txt</code> file.</p>
<p>You’re going to notice when you import the file that the table needs some cleaning.</p>

Population figures for the infant age groups are the number of live births. Note: Rates and population figures for years 2001 - 2009 differ slightly from previously published reports, due to use of the population estimates which were available at the time of release.</li>
<li>The population figures used in the calculation of death rates for the age group ‘under 1 year’ are the estimates of the resident population that is under one year of age. More information: http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/ucd.html#Age Group.</li>
<li>Beginning with the 2018 data, changes have been implemented that affect the counts for ICD-10 cause of death codes O00-O99 compared to previous practice. In addition, data for the cause of death codes O00-O99 for 2003 through 2017 reflect differences in information available to individual states and probable errors. Caution should be used in interpreting these data. More information can be found at: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/maternal-mortality/.</li>

<p>This is all important information and we should keep it in mind as we go about our analysis. …but this is metadata, not data for analysis. or the purposes of our data analysis, we are going to Hide that column.</p>
<section id="question" class="level6">
<h6 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="question">Question</h6>
<div class="question">
<p>Click on the downward triangle on the Notes column and select Hide.</p>
<p><img src="img/hide_col.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div>
<p>Now that we have hidden that column, there are a series of empty rows at the bottom of our dataset. We are going to filter those out.</p>
</section>
<section id="question-1" class="level6">
<h6 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="question-1">Question</h6>
<div class="question">
<p>Click on the “Add” link next to Filters in the top right corner of Tableau. Click Add, and select Race - a variable that shouldn’t have any missing values in this dataset. Click OK, and then check all boxes, except for “Null” to filter out the null values.</p>
<p><img src="img/filter_null.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
</div>
<p>You will also notice that both the <code>Deaths</code> column and the <code>Crude Rate</code> column were assumed to contain text data, even though those columns are supposed to report numeric quantities. This is because, in certain subsets, the CDC “Suppressed” the data or determined it to be “Unreliable”. Any time fewer than 10 deaths would be reported in a subset of data, the CDC suppressed the death count to protect the privacy of the individuals in that subset. This means that the more specific you make your data request, the more likely it will be that data gets suppressed (because fewer people will be represented in each subset). Any time fewer than 20 deaths are reported, the crude rate is considered to be “Unreliable.” While this is helpful information for us, in order to plot the data, we need those columns to both be numeric.</p>
</section>
<section id="question-2" class="level6">
<h6 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="question-2">Question</h6>
<div class="question">
<p>Click on the number ‘Abc’ symbol in both the <code>Deaths</code> column and the <code>Crude Rate</code> column and convert the columns to numeric. Make sure you select the <code>Crude Rate</code> column is displayed in decimals.</p>

<p>We need to repeat this for the remainder of files we will use in the lab. However one of the files has some special formatting issues.</p>

<div class="question">
<p>In the top menu, click Data &gt; New Data Source. Add either <code>year_pregnancy.txt</code> or <code>race_year_pregnancy.txt</code>.</p>
<p>Repeat the formatting steps for the file you choose, and then repeat this process for the two other text files.</p>
<p>When you get to <code>race_pregnancy_2020.txt</code>, we need to take one additional step. Tableau does not recognize the delimiters in this file. Add the file to see what I mean. See how the table looks quite off?</p>
<p><img src="img/failed_delim.png" class="img-fluid"> To fix this, click on the downward arrow next to the file name in your data view, and then select “Text File Properties”. Set the Field Separator to “Tab”.</p>

<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="column-plots">Column Plots</h5>
<p>Column plots are particularly useful for comparing the numeric values associated with different categories. They typically involve a categorical variable on the x-axis and a numeric variable on the y-axis. We can make sense of how categories differ by comparing the heights of each bar. In column plots, height serves as a <em>visual aesthetic</em> - some feature of a plot that communicates something about the values in our data.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that all of this data has already been aggregated. We do not need to sum, average, or perform any other operation on the reported values because both the <code>Deaths</code> value and the <code>Crude Rate</code> are calculated for a specific subset of people. They are <em>Attributes</em> not <em>Measures</em>. By default, Tableau will SUM the measure when you drag it onto your worksheet. You can keep it this way as long as you are sure that values represented on the plot are specific to one row of data (meaning there’s nothing being aggregated in the worksheet).</p>

<p class="heading"></p>
<p>Note how, in this new plot, we are no longer using height to visualize differences across categories. Instead, we are using both area and color to visualize the differences. Area and color are also visual aesthetics.</p>
<p>Notably, we are visualizing both area and color in a <em>continuous</em> way. Larger boxes are associated with larger values, and smaller boxes are associated with smaller values. Color is displayed on a gradient with darker colors associated with larger values and lighter colors associated with smaller values. The area size is specific to a numeric value, and the shade of color is specific to a numeric value. Indeed, it makes sense to use a color gradient when visualizing numeric data.</p>
<p>This differs from visualizing color in a <em>discrete</em> way.</p>

<p class="heading"></p>
<p>Note how in this plot, colors are not displayed on a gradient. Instead, there are discrete colors associated with each race. This is because we differentiating color along a categorical variable, where there are discrete divisions between categories. In general, we want to use discrete color palettes when associating color with a categorical variable and continuous color palettes when associated color with a numeric variable.</p>

<section id="stacked-column-plots" class="level5">
<h5 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stacked-column-plots">Stacked Column Plots</h5>
<p>In the last series of plots, we were only visualizing one categorical variable. …but sometimes, we want to compare numeric values across some intersection of categorical variables. In this case, we will create a stacked column plot, using both height and color as visual aesthetics.</p>
<div class="question">
<p>Create a new worksheet in Tableau called “U.S. Maternal Mortality, 2020”. Name the tab “race_2020_age”. Click on <code>race_age_pregnancy_2020</code> in the “Data” tab. Drag <code>Ten-Year Age Groups</code> to the Columns field and <code>Crude Rate</code> to the Rows field. Drag <code>Race</code> to the Color field. Note how a <em>discrete</em> color palette is created.</p>
<p>Click on the “Show Me” button, and select the side-by-side bars. I personally prefer this type of plot over a stacked bar plot because I find it easier to compare across categories when the bars are side-by-side. Move around the order of the variables to make the most compelling plot. Add a Filter to only show the relevant age groups.</p>

<p>How might we summarize what we just learned into a factual claim?</p>
<p>Note that this data is often cited as evidence of racial disparities in healthcare. The CDC website includes a webpage titled “<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthequity/features/maternal-mortality/index.html">Working Together to Reduce Black Maternal Mortality</a>,” and cites this data as evidence of racial disparities. Here are just a few examples of other articles that also do so:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kff.org/racial-equity-and-health-policy/issue-brief/racial-disparities-in-maternal-and-infant-health-current-status-and-efforts-to-address-them/">Racial Disparities in Maternal and Infant Health: Current Status and Efforts to Address Them</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/american-black-women-face-disproportionately-high-rates-of-maternal-mortality">American Black women face disproportionately high rates of maternal mortality</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bcbs.com/the-health-of-america/reports/racial-disparities-in-maternal-health">Racial Disparities in Maternal Health</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/05/10/722143121/why-racial-gaps-in-maternal-mortality-persist">Why Racial Gaps In Maternal Mortality Persist</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/25/us/visualizing-us-black-maternal-healthcare-inequities/index.html">Visualizing the stark maternal health inequities in the United States</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In my research, I came across one article that countered these claims in spite of the data evidence. “<a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/a-woke-panic-on-maternal-mortality">A Woke Panic on Maternal Mortality</a>” argues that activists and academics have exploited the data to push a narrative of systemic racism in healthcare. In small groups, read through this article and try to identify the arguments that the authors use to counter the claims often made from the data. How would you respond to their counter-arguments? What evidence could you provide in your response?</p>
