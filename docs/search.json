    "text": "Data is a powerful tool for making claims - claims that can advance equity and social justice, as well as claims that can misrepresent civic issues and marginalize communities. This course examines how power operates in and through the production, analysis, and presentation of data, while helping students develop skill in approaching data science work in more ethical and equitable ways.\nIn this course, students will examine the socio-political forces that impact the availability, structure, and governance of data regarding various social justice issues. Students will also learn techniques for presenting data in ways that foreground the contexts of data production and remain accountable to diverse communities. Datasets about health equity, housing justice, environmental justice, and carceral justice will be studied, analyzed, and visualized. In doing so, students will learn to identify the diverse institutions and stakeholders involved in data production, unpack the cultural histories and vested interests animating data semantics, consider what people and problems gets erased in data structuring, and evaluate the ethical tradeoffs that data scientists grapple with as they plan for the presentation of data.\n\n\n\n\nCommunicate how cultural, political, and technical forces shape the collection, categorization, presentation, and publication of data\nExamine data semantics and the power-laden semiotic systems from which they emerge\nRecognize how diverse data manipulation and visualization techniques applied to the same dataset can produce competing claims and evaluate which techniques best align with advancing social justice and equity\nProduce data visualizations that foreground the contexts of data production and demonstrate accountability to the people represented by the numbers\n\nClasses will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:20 PM to 2:35 PM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLindsay Poirier, she/her/hers.\n\n\n\n\n\nI am a cultural anthropologist that studies how civic data gets produced, how communities think about and interface with data, and how data infrastructure can be designed more equitably. My Ph.D. is in an interdisciplinary discipline called Science and Technology Studies - a field that studies the intricate ways science, technology, culture, and politics all co-constitute each other. I work on a number of collaborative research projects that leverage public data to deepen understanding of social and environmental inequities in the US, while also qualitatively studying the politics behind data gaps and inconsistencies. As an instructor, I prioritize active learning and often structure courses as flipped classrooms. You can expect in-class time to predominantly involve group activities and live problem-solving exercises.\n\n\n\nSlackMeeting with Me\n\n\nI can best support students in this course when I can readily keep tabs on our course-related communication. Because of this, I ask that you please don’t email me regarding course-related questions or issues. The best way to get in touch with me is via our course Slack. If you have course-related questions, I encourage you to ask them in the #fys-189-questions channel. When discretion is needed, feel free to DM. Please reserve more formal concerns like grades or accommodation requests for an in-person (or in-person virtual) conversation.\nDuring the week, I will try my best to answer all Slack messages within 24 hours of receiving them. Please note that to maintain my own work-life balance, I often don’t answer Slack messages late in the evenings or on the weekends. It’s important that you plan when you start your assignments accordingly.\n\n\nMeeting with me outside of class is a great opportunity for us to chat about what you’re learning in the course, clarify expectations on assignments, and review work in progress. I also love when students drop in to office hours to request book recommendations, discuss career or research paths, or just to say hi!\nThere are two ways to meet with me. If you would like to have a one-on-one private conversation, I ask that you schedule an appointment with me via the booking form on Moodle. For support on class topics, you may drop-in during my regularly scheduled office hours.\n\nMonday, 11-12, McConnell 214\nTuesday, 11-12, McConnell 214\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI will make all course readings available on Perusall, which can be accessed through our course Moodle page.\n\n\n\nThis course will be graded via a grading contract.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJacobson Center\n\n\n\nSmith’s Jacobson Center asserts that all students can improve their communication and learning skills. I encourage all students to take advantage of their writing support services, workshops, and tutors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreparationAttendanceExtensionsAcademic HonestyParticipationReadings\n\n\nThis is a 4-credit course with 3 hours per week of in-classroom instructions. Smith expects students to devote 9 out-of-class hours per week to 4-credit classes. I have designed the course assignments and selected the course readings with this target in mind.\n\n\nAttending class is not only important for your learning but also an act of community. Many course assignments will be completed in-class, and many critical thinking skills will be honed in class.\nAttendance will be taken in the first 10 minutes of each class. You may miss three classes with no penalty. You do not need to inform me that you will be absent in these cases. After the third unexcused absence, your grade may drop by a modifier for each class missed. Students arriving more than 10 minutes late for class without having informed me ahead of time will be marked as absent.\nIf you must miss a class entirely, you should contact a peer to discuss what was missed. Please note that the SDS Program has adopted a shared policy regarding in-person attendance this semester:\n\nIn keeping with Smith’s core identity and mission as an in-person, residential college, SDS affirms College policy (as per the Provost and Dean of the College) that students will attend class in person. SDS courses will not provide options for remote attendance. Students who have been determined to require a remote attendance accommodation by the Office of Disability Services will be the only exceptions to this policy. As with any other kind of ADA accommodations, please notify your instructor during the first week of classes to discuss how we can meet your accommodations.\n\n\n\nI understand that you will sometimes need to prioritize other things over meeting assignment deadlines (e.g. your health, wellness, families, communities, jobs, other coursework). There is a 24-hour grace period on all written assignments. There will be no penalties for submitting the written assignment within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any written assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted.\nNote that this policy does not apply to reading assignments/Perusall annotations. Reading assignments/Perusall annotations need to be completed by the due date for credit.\n\n\n\nSmith College expects all students to be honest and committed to the principles of academic and intellectual integrity in their preparation and submission of course work and examinations. Students and faculty at Smith are part of an academic community defined by its commitment to scholarship, which depends on scrupulous and attentive acknowledgement of all sources of information, and honest and respectful use of college resources. Any cases of dishonesty or plagiarism will be reported to the Academic Honor Board. Examples of dishonesty or plagiarism include:\n\n\nSubmitting work completed by another student as your own.\nCopying and pasting words from sources without quoting and citing the author.\nParaphrasing material from another source without citing the author.\nFailing to cite your sources correctly.\nFalsifying or misrepresenting information in submitted work.\nPaying another student or service to complete assignments for you.\nSubmitting work generated by artificially intelligent tools such as chatGPT\n\n\n\nActive participation in this course is generally expected and encouraged. That said, we all have off-days - be it from illness, sadness, heartbreak, or exhaustion. I too will have off-days where my words just don’t seem to cohere, or my brain will feel jumbled. Because of this, I’ve provided a number of ways to demonstrate engagement throughout the semester.\n\n\nI have put a lot of thought into the assigned readings for this course - aiming to select pieces that are relevant, engaging, challenging, accessible, and represent a diverse set of voices. Our classroom discussions will be much richer, more meaningful, and fun when all students come to class having completed and annotated assigned course readings. While I know that reading may seem like a low priority when you have impending assignments that you need to physically hand-in, I encourage you not to wait until the last minute to complete course readings. You will get the most out of the content if you give yourself time to digest and reflect on it.\nIf you are struggling to keep up with the readings, please reach out to me. I’m more than happy to talk through effective reading strategies and to provide more guidance on what I’d like you to get out of a specific piece.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode of ConductPrinciples of CommunityPronouns\n\n\nAs the instructor for this course, I am committed to making participation in this course a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion. Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants in this course include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.\nAs the instructor I have the right and responsibility to point out and stop behavior that is not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Participants who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be reprimanded for such behavior. Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the instructor.\nAll students and the instructor are expected to adhere to this Code of Conduct in all settings for this course: seminars, office hours, and over Slack.\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.0.0, available here.\n\n\nI hope that we can foster a collaborative and caring environment in this classroom: one that celebrates successes, respects individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrates compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirms diverse identities. Here are some ideas that I have for creating this environment in our course:\n\nCheck-in with colleagues before starting collaborative work. “What three words describe how you’re feeling?” “Name one challenge and one success from this week.” “What are you doing for self-care right now?” Thank each other for sharing where they’re at.\nConsider when to step up and when to step back in class discussions, creating space for others to contribute. Listening is just as important to community-building as speaking.\nAcknowledge that there is much we don’t know about how our colleagues experience the world. …but don’t ask colleagues to speak on behalf of a social group you perceive them to be a part of.\nCheer on colleagues as they give presentations or try something out for the first time.\nAsk questions often in our #fys-189-questions channel. Help each other out by answering questions when you can.\nMistakes happen. I will certainly make mistakes in class. Admit mistakes, and then move on.\n\n\n\nUsing the proper pronouns for our students is foundational to a safe, respectful classroom environment that creates a culture of trust. For information on pronouns and usage, please see the Office of Equity and Inclusion link here: Pronouns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccommodationsStudent Well-beingTrigger Warnings\n\n\nIt is my goal for everyone to succeed in this course. If you have personal circumstances that may impact your experience of our classroom, I encourage you to contact Office of Disability Services in College Hall 104 or at ods@smith.edu. The Office will generate a letter that indicates to me what kind of support you need and how I can make your classroom experience more accommodating. Once you have this letter, you are welcome to visit my office hours or email me to discuss ideas about how we can tailor the course accordingly. While you can request accommodations at any time, the sooner we start this conversation, the better. If you have concerns about the course that are not addressed through ODS, please contact me. At no point will I ask you to divulge details about your personal circumstances to me.\n\n\nCollege life is stressful, and life outside of college can be overwhelming. It is my position that attending to your physical and mental health and well-being should be a top priority. I will remind you of this often throughout the semester. I encourage you to schedule a time to talk with me if you are struggling with this course. If you, or anyone you know, is experiencing distress, there are numerous campus resources that can provide support via the Schacht Center. I can point you to these resources at any time throughout the semester.\n\n\nA trigger is a topic or image that can precipitate an intense emotional response. When common triggering topics are to be covered in this course, I will do my best to provide a trigger warning in advance of the discussion. However, I can’t always anticipate triggers. With this in mind I’ve set up an anonymous form, available on Moodle, where you can indicate topics for which you would like me to provide a warning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoodlePerusallSlack\n\n\nGrades, forms, and handouts will be available on the course Moodle.\n\n\nAll course readings and recorded lectures will be available on Perusall. You can access Perusall via our course Moodle page.\n\n\n\n#general: Course announcements (only I can post)\n#fys-189-discussions: Share news articles and relevant opportunities\n#fys-189-questions: Ask and answer questions about our course"

Ask questions that encourage elaboration and description.\nConsider how to frame questions so that they make sense to the interviewee:\n\nMy research question: What values inform your data work?\nMy interview questions:\n\nWhat motivated you get involved in this work?\nWho were your primary inspirations in this area and why?\nWhat theorists/books were you reading as you got involved in this work?

Regularly ask interviewees to elaborate by asking “how?” and “why?” questions.\nTakes notes on things the recording can’t pick up on (e.g. Body language, Tone, Things you are reminded of as they’re speaking)\n\n\n\n\nEngaging during the Interview\n\nEngage in active listening (direct eye contact, nodding)\nDon’t rush the interviewee to move onto a new question.\nIf the conversation veers allow it momentarily and then politely redirect it with a statement like, “I’d like to return to what you were saying about… Can you describe…?”\nInterviews can be vulnerable experiences. Earning trust demands demonstrating empathy and non-judgment. Preface difficult conversations, and offer breaks if appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nEngaging during the Interview, cont.\n\nDon’t try and finish an interviewee’s sentences. Allow for small moments of silence between questions to confirm that they’re done speaking.\nAvoid explicitly sharing personal opinions on what they’ve said. This can change how they respond in to future questions.\nContemplate ways to reframe questions that an interviewee evades, exaggerates, or provides limited information on.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions to consider:\n\nWhy does Biruk refer to the fieldworkers as “knowledge workers”? What kind of ethnographic move is this?\nBiruk continuously refers to “boundary work” in this chapter? Can you extrapolate what she means by this? What are the effects of enacting boundary work in fieldwork?\nWhat is “local knowledge”? How do credibility contests around “local knowledge” play out in this chapter?"

    "text": "This course will be using a grading contract. This means that the grade you ultimately receive for this course is primarily based on the labor that you perform rather than a subjective evaluation of the quality of your work and writing in relation to your peers. Your grade will be determined by the extent of your engagement in class, your timely completion of assignments, and how you support the course community. You will still attend to and work to improve the quality of your writing and thinking in this course. You will receive extensive feedback on all of your submissions (from me and from your peers), and you will have opportunities to revise. However, you will not receive points or an A, B, C, D, etc. on assignments.\nThere are many benefits to contract grading. Here are there reasons why I’ve opted for a grading contract in this course:"

    "title": "Grading Contract",
    "section": "FAQ",
    "text": "FAQ\n\nWhat do I need to do to earn an A in this course?\n‘A’ grades will be assigned to students that meet the requirements to earn a ‘B’ in the course and enrich those assignments by completing three additional reflective assignments. Prompts for these assignments will be included in the GitHub repository for your learning portfolio. The deadline for completion of enrichment assignments is the last day class meets. It will be the students’ responsibility to stay on top of completion of these assignments. Furthermore, enrichment assignments completed prior to the last two weeks of class will receive more substantive feedback from me than assignments completed in the last two weeks.\n\n\nWhat kind of feedback will I receive regarding my work?\nYou will receive extensive feedback on all of your submissions (from me and from your colleagues), and you will have opportunities to revise. I will also provide rubrics for most assignments to indicate how I will evaluate your work. However, you will not receive points or an A, B, C, D, etc. on individual assignments.\n\n\nHow can I best keep track of my labor in this course?\nThroughout the semester, you will be asked to keep track of your labor via a log that will be available in your GitHub portfolio. I will reference this log to calculate certain aspects of your final grade. Instructions for using the labor log will be provided in the second week of the course.\n\n\nCan I earn +/- grades in this course?\n+/- will be assigned to final grades at my discretion in cases where a student’s work consistently exceeds the expectations (+) of their contracted grade or is in some way insufficient (-). Students can track their progress towards a grade modifier in feedback that I provide throughout the semester. Your grade may also be reduced by a grade modifier for each missed class beyond three absences.\n\n\nWhat if I need an extension on an assignment?\nThere is a 24-hour grace period on all written assignments, except for reading annotations. There will be no penalties for submitting the written assignment within this 24-hour period, and you do not need to inform me that you intend to take the extra time. You can also request up to a 72-hour extension on any written assignment, as long as you make that request at least 48 hours before the original assignment due date. You can request an extension by filling out the Extension Request form on Moodle, and I will confirm your extension on Slack. Beyond this, late assignments will not be accepted.\n\n\nCan I ask for extensions or use the grade period for reading annotations?\nReading assignments/Perusall annotations prepare you to participate in class discussions. For this reason, they need to be completed by the due date for credit. I’ve provided considerable leeway to miss a reading annotation assignment from time-to-time in order to accommodate flexibility in this regard.\n\n\nAn assignment deadline is approaching, and I’m unhappy with the quality of my work. What should I do?\nWhile I always encourage students to strive to submit the best work they can, this course’s grading contract, coupled with the course’s revision assignments, permits you to submit work that you know you want to continue to improve upon without penalty. Not submitting assignments at all has the potentially to significantly lower your grade in this course, whereas submitting an assignment that could benefit from more revision will not be detrminental to your grade as long as the minimum submission requirements are met."

David Floyd and David Ourlicht argued that the NYPD had stopped them without reasonable suspicion, and the resulting high-profile case centered around issues of racial profiling in NYC policing. Much of the case against stop and frisk was built from data documenting racial breakdowns of the individuals stopped each year, along with the reason for the stop and the results of the stop. This data was aggregated from a series of forms (known as UF-250s) that officers are required to fill out and report following a stop. These forms collectively showed that 85% of those stopped were Black and Latino despite these sub-groups comprising just over half of the city’s population."

The central flaws in this database all skew toward underestimating the number of unconstitutional stops that occur: the database is incomplete, in that officers do not prepare a UF-250 for every stop they make; it is one-sided, in that the UF250 only records the officer’s version of the story; the UF-250 permits the officer to merely check a series of boxes, rather than requiring the officer to explain the basis for her suspicion; and many of the boxes on the form are inherently subjective and vague (such as ‘furtive movements’). Nonetheless, the analysis of the UF-250 database reveals that at least 200,000 stops were made without reasonable suspicion."

This database came into existence alongside CompStat- a crime reduction strategy implemented in NYC in the 1990s. CompStat required precincts to produce weekly statistics regarding crime rates, officer deployments, stops, and arrests in their communities in order to generate evidence of policing effectiveness. The idea was to hold officers accountable through “timely and accurate intelligence” and “relentless follow-up and assessment.” However, with certain consequences tied to failures to demonstrate reductions in crime, the policies institutionally incentivized data manipulation - an issue colloquially referred to as “juking the stats.” Whistleblowing officers have presented audio recordings of their commanders demanding that they conduct more stops to meet quotas, and deceptively classifying crimes."

These are all examples of data quality issues regarding “disclosure datasets” - tabular datasets produced in accordance with laws requiring various kinds of disclosure. The most significant defining feature of disclosure datasets is that they aggregate information produced and reported by the same institutions they are meant to hold accountable. Further, the values reported in disclosure datasets can lead to adverse actions - either formal or informal – taken against the reporting institutions.

Examples include Yelp reviews of businesses and student evaluations of teaching effectiveness. We might also contrast disclosure data with surveillance data – where real-time technological systems track activities to hold folks accountable. Examples of such data include police body cameras and consumer credit tracking. Karen Levy’s work on electronic monitoring systems in the US trucking industry provides a compelling narrative on the social impact of surveillance data. In recognition that each of these datasets emerge from situated and delimited perspectives, we can point to concerns regarding data quality and bias in all of these classes of accountability data.\nIn what follows, I will focus on three kinds of data quality concerns that arise based on the institutional configurations that underpin the production of records for disclosure datasets:"

    "text": "False Reporting\n\n\n\nLying or misreporting data\nAuditing can be challenging\n\n\n Sample HMDA Data Collection Form\n\n\n\nFalse reporting involves deliberate efforts to falsify records; it’s flat out lying. While institutions that aggregate disclosure reports into a dataset often attempt to curb false reporting through auditing efforts, small scale instances of false reporting can be inordinately difficult to detect given that the data systems are designed to tell the story from the perspective of the reporters.\nFor example, in order to ensure that financial institutions are in compliance with fair lending laws in the U.S. (such as the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act), lenders are required to collect and report data on an applicant’s ethnicity, race, gender, and income when they apply for a mortgage. When reporting data relating to race, ethnicity, and gender, lenders are legally required to submit the information that applicants self-report when filling out a loan application to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). However, in cases where an applicant elects not to provide their demographic data, lenders are required to record race, ethnicity, and gender based on visual observation of the applicant or the applicant’s surname. In one of the most notable cases of intentional HMDA misreporting, a CFPB investigation found that, for over three years, loan officers at Freedom Mortgage (one of the top ten lending institutions in the U.S.) were instructed to list “non-Hispanic White” as the race and ethnicity for every applicant that elected not to provide demographic data.\nSimilarly one of the most novel disclosure datasets my lab has been looking at is called Open Payments. To monitor for potential medical conflicts of interest, medical drug and device companies are required to disclose payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals. This is mandated by the passing of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act (2010). Until recently, there has been little enforcement of the Sunshine Act, so cases of misreporting or failures to report have gone largely unrecognized. …but in 2020, the first settlement for violations to the Sunshine Act was announced. In efforts to get a South Dakota neurosurgeon to adopt their infusion pumps, Medtronic agreed to sponsor more than 100 events at a restaurant the neurosurgeon owned. Medtronic agreed to pay $9.2 million to resolve allegations for failure to report.\nIn terms of data quality, false reporting calls into question the accuracy and validity of the data."

For instance, institutions might take advantage of loopholes in reporting standards or leverage vagueness in the reporting requirements to cast their activities in a more positive light.\nAn example of this comes from the environmental health domain. The EPA’s Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act (EPCRA) of 1986 established the Toxic Release Inventory as a mechanism to monitor and inform the public of toxic emissions released in their communities. Every year, certain U.S. industrial facilities are required to report to the EPA the amounts of certain chemical on-site and off-site releases.\nNotably, while this Act mandates reporting of emissions, it does not mandate monitoring of emissions. While other environmental regulations do set certain monitoring standards for specific TRI chemicals and pollution activities, for all other chemicals and activities, facilities are required to report based on a “reasonable estimate” of releases and other waste management quantities. Because the data is self-reported, this provides a lot of flexibility to facilities to determine how they go about measuring emissions. Studies have shown that year-to-year changes in emissions at large facilities often have more to do with changes in estimation methods and interpretations of the law, rather than actual reductions in emissions. These are often called “phantom reductions” - where emissions just disappear from the books without indication of how the facility actually cleaned up their act.\nIn our research into disclosure datasets, my lab has identified a number of other examples of deceptive accounting. For instance, when reporting campaign spending, candidates will sometimes hide large payments by submitting them to consulting firms that then disburse the payments to other organizations. Historically, candidates did not have to disclose the payments’ ultimate recipients. …and the concept of “juking the stats” in policing is a direct example of this deceptive accounting practice, with officers learning to play the CompStat numbers game.\nIn terms of data quality, deceptive accounting calls into question the representativeness of the data - or in other words, the degree to which it represents what we think it represents."

These standards are not neutral, and tend to evolve as stakeholders with certain political commitments towards transparency and institutional accountability call for amendments. Certain stakeholders advocate on behalf of stricter requirements and more data reporting in efforts to secure transparency and accountability, whereas other stakeholders advocate on behalf of loosening the requirements. Notably, one of the most powerful weapons against strengthening disclosure dataset programs has been discourse around “regulatory burden”. Businesses cite the cost and lack of feasibility of filling out paperwork when advocating against data collection. For instance, under the George W. Bush Administration, the TRI “Burden Reduction Rule” significantly raised the threshold regarding how much pollution a facility needed to emit before reporting requirements kicked in. Just recently, amendments to HMDA raised the threshold regarding the volume of loans a bank needs a originate for reporting requirements to kick in. The pressures Covid-19 had placed on banks was cited as a reason for this change. … and regulatory burden discourse has been effectively leveraged to keep the US’s National Use of Force database – where police officers disclose when they use force against citizens – a voluntary data program.\nWhen regulatory burden discourse is successful, fewer institutions are required to report on fewer activities, diminishing what is tracked in the data. Thresholds tend to fluctuate in line with political changeover. For instance, the stringency of TRI reporting often correlates with the political leanings of presidential administrations. This has meant that the definitions underpinning disclosure datasets are quite malleable - subject to change in conjunction with different modes of social advocacy. This malleability is a double-edged sword for many community groups calling for increased accountability. In one sense, it ensures that disclosure programs can continuously be strengthened. However, changing reporting standards makes it difficult to perform year-to-year comparisons of the data. …which is often needed to measure whether institutions are “cleaning up” their acts.\nIn terms of data quality, this discursive risk calls into question the scope and comprehensiveness of the data."

    "section": "Final Project Resources",
    "text": "Final Project Resources\nThis semester your project group will develop a user guide for a federal dataset. You will complete a series of exercises in class to support you in writing the guide. These exercises are not graded; they are meant to frame your research and help you generate material for the project. You should work on relevant aspects of them weekly with your group in order to make progress towards the final product. While these exercises will include both qualitative and computational exercises, the point of this project is not to perform a statistical analysis on this dataset. Instead, you will study the dataset ethnographically and strive to effectively communicate how the dataset came to be, how it has disseminated, how it can be used, and what some of its limitations are.\n\nProject Description\nRose’s Project Guide Sheet\nDataset Loading Instructions\nExample User Guide\n\nBelow I’ve outlined completion criteria for the two non-written assignments for this course.\n\nReading Annotations\nEach week a selection of course readings will be posted as a single assignment on Perusall - a system for students to collaboratively annotate course readings. To earn this credit, you will be expected to post 3 quality annotations per assignment to Perusall. (Note that a single assignment can have multiple readings, but you need only submit 3 annotations total. You do not need to annotate every reading in the assignment.) A quality annotation is one in which you synthesize concepts, ask thought-provoking questions, or connect ideas to external issues. I have found that students get the most out of Perusall when they respond to each other’s annotations. Annotations must be completed before class to receive credit.\n\n\nCommunity Labor\nEthnography is at its best when it involves collaborative inquiry and interpretation. Because of this, I want to encourage us to foster a cooperative community in our classroom. Ethnographers know that building and sustaining strong communities are important and often invisible forms of labor. In an effort to foreground and reward that labor, I’ve built opportunities to contribute to the course community into our grading contract. There are four opportunities for earning community labor points in this course. It will be your responsibility to keep track of your community labor via our course labor log (see FAQ).\n\nContributing on Slack\nThe first opportunity for earning community labor points is through posting in the #sds-237-discussions Slack channel. For every conversation that you initiate in this channel, you will earn 1 community labor point. For every conversation that you respond to in this channel with substantive summary, critique, or reflection, you will earn 1 community labor point. Finally, for every question that you answer in the #sds-237-questions channel, you will earn 1 community labor point.\n\n\nCompleting Group Evaluations\nMid-way through the semester you will have an opportunity to evaluate your own contributions to your group work, along with that of your peers. Your feedback will be shared with members of your group. Completing group evaluations will count for 1 community labor point.\n\n\nParticipating in Peer Review Workshops\nThroughout the semester, I will set up workshops where students may submit their written work for peer review in preparation for assignment submissions. Each peer review workshop that you participate in will count for 2 community labor points.\n\n\nContributing Class Notes\nFollowing a class period, up to two students may type up a 1-page outline of what was covered in that class period and post a link to that outline in #sds-237-class-notes. You can sign-up to serve as the notetaker for a certain class here. These notes should be a full, single-space page, and should make sense to someone that was not present in class. Each class note outline that you contribute will count for 2 community labor points.\nNote that throughout the semester, I may offer additional opportunities to earn community labor points as unexpected forms of course labor arise.\n\nThe final project will be completed in groups, and considerable chunks of the group project will be completed in class on Thursdays. While I will not formally be taking attendance for this course, I reserve the right to adjust your final grade by a letter grade if you’ve missed more than three classes involving final project group work. Be sure to reach out to me early on if there are extenuating circumstances that will consistently impact your attendance."

    "text": "Why a grading contract?\nThere are many benefits to contract grading. Here are there reasons why I’ve opted for a grading contract in this course:\n\nI want you to feel as though you can experiment with your writing in this course. Rather than focusing on what you think I want out of your assignments or “writing to the rubric,” grading contracts empower you to take more risks.\nGrading contracts value the time and effort you put into the course and reward students who invest extra time in their learning.\nGrading contracts make it easier for you to anticipate the grade you will receive and plan for achieving that grade.\nGrading contracts promote equity. With grades based entirely on labor, students aren’t penalized for not entering the course with the same experience or background knowledge as their peers."

It also must be completed “in good faith” - meaning in a way that demonstrates integrity to the spirit of the assignment. Note that you have at least one “gimme” for each assignment in this course. This means that if for some reason there was a misunderstanding of the expectations for completion, in most cases, you will have an opportunity to try again as long as you haven’t already missed other assignments in the same category."

    "text": "Assignments\n\nBlog Posts\nFor each blog post, you will use data we study in the course to produce a compelling data visualization in Tableau documenting an issue you believe warrants public concern. Referencing case study materials and the data documentation, you will write an 800-word blog post that presents your data visualization and helps the audience responsibly interpret the visualization by describing “what counts” in the data, providing some context on the social contexts of the data’s production, and detailing what people and issues have been erased from the data and why. You will reflect on the decisions you made in producing the visualization, summarize some conclusions we can draw it, and conclude with a call to action outlining something that should be done based on these conclusions.\n\n\nFinal Project\nFor the final project, you will choose a dataset on a social justice topic of interest to you and evaluate how data analysis techniques could be applied to the dataset to support diverse, and sometimes conflicting claims. There are 4 components to the final paper:\n\nYou will study various sources to unpack the cultural history of the dataset and the contexts of its production.\nYou will produce two compelling visualizations of the dataset in Tableau to support a particular claim.\nYou will then produce two visualizations of the same dataset in Tableau that refute that claim.\nYou will then be expected to write a 1500-word argumentative paper that makes a claim, provides data-based evidence to support that claim, presents counter-arguments with the same data, and finally discusses why these arguments fail to refute the claim.\n\nThroughout this paper, you will be expected to present the evidence in ways that foreground the cultural contexts of the data’s production and reflect on the choices made in data visualization. You will complete checkpoints towards this final project each week of the semester to ensure that there is plenty of time to incorporate feedback provided by me and your peers into the final product.\n\n\nReading Annotations\nEach week a selection of course readings will be posted on Perusall. For each selection, you will be expected to post 3 quality annotations. A quality annotation is one in which you synthesize concepts, ask thought-provoking questions, or connect ideas to external issues. I have found that students get the most out of Perusall when they respond to each other’s annotations. Annotations must be completed before class to receive credit.\n\n\nCommunity Labor Points\nIt’s important to me that we establish a collaborative learning environment in this course. Work to build and sustain communities is often an invisible form of labor. In an effort to foreground and reward that labor, I’ve built opportunities to contribute to the course community into our grading contract. To earn a ‘B’ or higher in the course, you will need to earn at least 8 community labor points. Note that there are certain forms of labor that you can perform more than once, but there are max points that you can earn in each category.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoints\nLabor\nMax Points\n\n\n\n\n+1\nStart a discussion thread on course-relevant topic in the #fys-189-discussions channel on Slack.1\nNone\n\n\n+1\nRespond to a discussion thread on Slack.\nNone\n\n\n+1\nLead an opening check-in.2\n1\n\n\n+2\nContribute class notes3\n2\n\n\n+3\nRecord a Tableau “skill share” and post it on Slack.\nNone\n\n\n\n\n1Note that this is separate from asking a question about the course administration or assignments in the #fys-189-questions channel.\n\n\n2Each class we will start out by participating in a collaborative poll to check-in with where our heads are. If you sign up to lead an opening check-in, you will create this opening poll by adding a slide to a deck I will make available on Moodle. Instructions for doing so will be available on the Slide. Then at the start of class, you will be called upon to launch/lead your check-in poll. You can sign-up to lead this opening session via a Scheduler on Moodle.\n\n\n3 Following a class period, up to two students may type up a 1-page outline of what was covered in that class period and post a link to that outline in #fys-189-class-notes. You can sign-up to serve as the notetaker for a certain class here. These notes should be a full, single-space page, and should make sense to someone that was not present in class.\n\nNote that throughout the semester, I may offer additional opportunities to earn community labor points as unexpected forms of course labor arise."

Timelines for completing enrichment must be coordinated with me in student consultation hours by the end of the third week of the semester.\n\nWrite a 500 to 750-word memo reflecting on your standpoint in relation to the arguments made in your first blog post. What gives you unique insight on the topic? What limits your knowledge on the topic? You should consider how your background, culture, education, and experiences have shaped the knowledge you have on the topic. Conclude your memo by outlining ideas that you have for transforming the blog post assignment to ensure that the data work pursues a “stronger objectivity.” Be sure to cite and define standpoint theory and strong objectivity in your response.\nVisceralize the dataset you are studying for your final project. Your visceralization should represent information derived from all of the observations in at least one variable in the dataset. It should also evoke at least one of the five senses. You can submit the visceralization in any format, but it should include a 250-word caption describing what you are intending to convey. Read more about data visceralization here and here.\nEarn the maximum (16) community labor points.\nCreate a concept map for our course. To create a concept map, you can begin by listing out ideas, concepts, datasets, people, institutions, and events that we’ve covered in this course. Begin organizing components of your lists into a series of nodes. When creating nodes, be sure to distinguish between topical details and course concepts. Organize the nodes into a meaningful visual representation of what we’ve been covering in the course. Use lines and arrows to indicate connections. You can also use varying colors and shapes to draw out differences. You can be as creative as you wish in designing the map, but it must include at least 25 nodes interconnected with lines and arrows. In a 250-word accompanying memo, describe your rationale for the organization of concepts in your map."

This is what we are looking to show differences in death rates by. Do you want to show differences in death rates by race, over time, by geography, by gender, by ethnicity? Three important notes:\n\nYou may select any grouping variables except for anything in the Cause of Death section. This is because we are going to filter to one cause of death.\nYou should select 2-3 grouping variables.\nIf you group by age-groups, be sure to select the checkbox for age-adjusted crude rate. Refer to the data documentation to learn why this is so important!\n\nBe sure to also title your dataset in Section 1.\n\n\n\nIn sections 2-5, you have the option to filter your results. Perhaps you just want to look at death rates in one state, in one year, for one demographic, etc. You would set those options here. Important notes:\n\nYou don’t have to apply any filters, but you may. If you don’t, your data will represent the death rates in the entire US from 1999 to 2021.\nIf you group by a variable, I don’t recommend you also filter by that variable. For example, if I choose to compare death rates across states, I will group my results by state. But if then I filter my data to MA, I’m not going to be able to compare across states because my data will only have one state.\nThe more specific your data is (i.e. the more you filter) the more likely you will have suppressed values. It’s ok to have some suppressed values in your analysis, but we don’t want all suppressed data!\n\nIn section 6, you should filter to one cause of death, and it can either be a specific cause, or a more general cause. For instance, I could select the entire set of codes for O00-O99 (Pregnancy, childbirth and the puerperium) to visualize pregnancy-related deaths. Alternatively, I could click on that category, and the click the button “Open” at the bottom of the screen to select a more specific cause in that category, such as O00-O07 (Pregnancy with abortive outcome).\n\nIf you are not sure where to find a certain cause, you can search for it via the Search button. If that doesn’t work feel free to ask in #fys-189-questions!\n\n\n\n\nIn section 7:\n\nCheck the box for Export results\nUncheck the box for Show totals\nCheck the boxes for Show 0 and Suppressed Values\nSet the Precision to 2 decimal places\n\n\n\n\nClick Send\nLoad the data into your visualization software, and remove the Notes column.\nHappy visualizing!"

Since critical access hospitals are often the only providers of health care in their communities, there is critical need for federal funding to be allocated towards supporting this healthcare infrastructure. Research by McFayden et al (2023) has shown how the operating profitability of critical access hospitals increased significantly during Covid-19 as a result of government-issued Public Health Emergency Funding. In the absence of this funding, profitability was much lower, and there were more hospitals with negative margins. McFayden et al (2023) thus argue that federal funding is a particularly important source of revenue for supporting the financial well-being of critical access hospitals. Ensuring critical access hospitals have the resources they need to operate is essential for providing equitable access to healthcare.\nMcFayden, Laura B., George H. Ping, Susie Gurzenda, Kristie Thompson, and Kristin L. Reiter. “The Impact of COVID-19 Funding on Profitability of Critical Access Hospitals.” Flex Monitoring Team (2023). https://www.flexmonitoring.org/sites/flexmonitoring.umn.edu/files/media/Impact_of_COVID19_funding_on_Profitability_of_CAHs.pdf"

    "section": "The Dataset",
    "text": "The Dataset\nThere are multiple standards that the U.S. federal government uses to assess poverty. The first and most common measure - the official poverty measure (OPM) - has been in use since the 1960s. This measure defines poverty by analyzing a family’s pre-tax income to a certain poverty threshold and adjusting for the size of the family. While this measure has a long history, many stakeholders were concerned that it paints an inadequate picture of poverty. With the support of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the SPM was introduced in 2011 to factor in a number of other vectors that mark poverty - access to government programs like food stamps, federal and state taxes, work expenses, food expenses, and geographic location.\nThe data that you will see today documents poverty in the U.S according to both measures. It was collected via the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplements (CPS ASEC). Each row in the dataset is one surveyed person in a U.S. household, and there are columns to mark the person’s demographics (age, race, ethnicity, gender, marital status), the person’s poverty status, the person’s income and expenses, and the person’s access to various government subsidies. The CPS is directed to the U.S. civilian noninstitutional population, and thus excludes incarcerated individuals, individuals in nursing homes, and the homeless population.\nIt’s important to note that this is not a survey of every person in the U.S. There are a number of reasons why it would be difficult to survey everyone in the U.S - it’s expensive, it takes a lot of time, not everyone wants to be surveyed, among other reasons. Instead, a subset of the total population (or, in other words, a sample of households) are surveyed. …but there are reasons why this sample might not be representative of the whole U.S. even if respondents were selected randomly. Certain communities may be under-surveyed if they live in areas that are difficult to reach, if they tend to refuse participation, or if they are more likely to be unavailable for surveying. Sometimes, when we look at the demographics of those that actually participated in a survey, the distributions of age, race, gender, etc do not match those of the US. To account for this, the CPS assigns weights to each survey response. The weight represents the theoretical number of people that a survey response represents within the total population. So if one survey response was assigned a weight of 144, this indicates that the survey collectors estimate that this survey response represents about 144 people in the total population.\nThis is a really important concept, so if you had trouble following the paragraph above, check out this video for further explanation:"

To do so, we want to count how many times 1 appeared in the dataset in this column, along with how many times 0 appeared in the dataset in this column. There is a special pill in the Measures section of Tableau that facilitates this. It’s the file name of your dataset followed by the word (Count).\n\nWith OFF Poor still in the Rows field of your worksheet, drag spm_pu_2021.sas7bdat (Count) to the Label field. You’ll see a table that looks like this.\n\nThis indicates to us how many survey respondents in this dataset were classified as in poverty according to the official poverty measure. …but recall from above that this dataset is a sample not a total count of every person in the U.S. and that certain categories of people might be more represented than others. Certain communities may have been over-surveyed, and others might have been under-surveyed. Zooming out to the entire U.S., we can’t assume that this is a representative ratio of individuals in poverty. To address this, we will need to factor in the survey weights.\nDrag the Wt pill to the Label field. Remember that the Wt field represents how many people in the population that the survey respondent represents. If Wt is 144 for one row in the dataset, it is assumed that there are 144 people in the U.S. that are represented by this survey response. This also means that the response will count more than a survey response that was assigned a weight of 80.\nBy default, Tableau sums this number, giving us an estimate of the total population classified as in poverty according to this measure. The table is difficult to read though, right? We can guess, but there are no labels that indicate which number is associated with the survey count vs. which number is associated with the weighted sum.\nWatch this video, which explains how to have different measures appear side-by-side in a plot.\n\nQuestion\n\nBased on the video, see if you can adjust the table we’ve been creating in these steps to look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can Edit Alias of the column names in your table to match my column names above.\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCreate a new worksheet in Tableau called “Poverty Counts - Supplemental Poverty Measure”. Rename the worksheet tab to match this title. Repeat the steps above to create a table that shows both the survey counts and weighted sum for the SPM Poor indicator. With which definition of poverty is the weighted sum greater? Any guesses as to why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCreate a new worksheet in Tableau called “SPM Poverty By Race” and rename the worksheet tab to something similar. Drag the Race variable to the Rows field, the SPM Poor variable to the Columns field, and the Wt variable to the label field. Ensure that the Wt field is being aggregated with SUM.

    "text": "Reformatting to Do No Harm\nThis week you read examples of “data harm” curated by the Data Justice Lab. As we start designing tables and visualizations in Tableau, it is important to think about how we can minimize harm in our data design practices.\nWatch this video, which details 10 “do no harm” recommendations from the Urban Institute.\nFollowing this, watch this video which details some formatting features in Tableau.\n\nQuestion\n\nIn the top right hand corner of the “SPM Poverty By Race” worksheet, click Show Me and select the icon with horizontal bars to convert the table that you just created to a bar chart.\n Right click “Not in Poverty” in your table and select “Hide”.\n Using some of the formatting features that you just learned, identify and apply at least two techniques to minimize harm in the plot. You can also use skills that you learned earlier in this workshop.\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\nCreate a new Worksheet called “SPM Poverty by Hispanic”, and rename the worksheet tab to something similar. Recreate “SPM Poverty by Race” but with the Hispanic variable."

    "text": "Definitions are operating in the background of every statistic. When I report the number or percentage of people that play sports, I have to first define what counts as a sport and what it means for someone to be a sports player (i.e. how often they play? how long they’ve been playing?) When I report the number or percentage of green spaces in a city, I have to first define what counts as a green space.\nWe often don’t take the time to critically examine definitions. We’re pretty used to seeing definitions reported in dictionaries or reference documents - documents that we don’t tend to classify as persuasive, rhetorical, or political. …but in fact, definitions are often a site of intense social and political debate. What counts as a life in the context of abortion politics? What counts as a terrorist in the context of domestic security? These terms may have formal definitions in laws and/or dictionaries, but those definitions are rarely stable and are continuously subject to contestation. They create boundaries of inclusion/exclusion, while necessarily leaving certain issues unaddressed.\nIn today’s activity, you are going to analyze the definitions a dataset denotatively, connotatively, and deconstructively:\n\nDenotatively, we are going to reference data documentation to examine the official/encoded definitions underpinning a dataset. You are going to reflect upon how these definitions set the boundaries of what counts.\nConnotatively, we are going to examine the provenance of that definition. When has the definition changed? Who or what prompted the definition to change, and with what social consequences? How did the numbers change as a result?\nDeconstructively, we are going to consider what the definition eclipses. What social groups or social issues get overshadowed as a result of this definition?\nWe’re also going to look at the categorizations of a dataset to determine which individuals may be categorically excluded, and which groups of people are rendered residual through the data."

    "text": "Instructions\nLast week, you worked with a dataset that offered two different definitions of poverty - the official poverty measure, and the supplemental poverty measure.\n\nPart 1: Denotative Reading\nIn your group find documentation of the official differences between these two definitions. Fill out the following table based on what you learn:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOfficial Poverty Measure\nSupplemental Poverty Measure\n\n\n\n\nIn Poverty\n\n\n\n\nNot In Poverty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Connotative Reading\nIn 2019, the U.S. Office of Management and Budgeting's Chief Statistician established an Interagency Technical Working Group on Evaluating Alternative Measures of Poverty. It had been almost 25 years since the establishment of the Supplemental Poverty Measure and 50 years since the establishment of the Official Poverty Measure. The goal of the working group was to address growing concerns about the quality of survey-based data (e.g. the accuracy of what individuals report in surveys). The Committee came up with a number of ideas on how an alternative measure of poverty might be determined. The video following summarizes some of the recommendations they came up with. (We will watch just a few clips in class).\n\n\nRegulations.gov is a website where the public can review and comment upon proposed changes to federal agency regulations. On February 14, 2020, a “Request for Comment on Considerations for Additional Measures of Poverty” was posted on Regulations.gov. 193 comments were submitted in response to the recommendation.\nIn your groups, click through a number of these public comments. Take notes on the following for each:\n\nWho is making the comment, and what stakeholder group are they a part of?\nWhat stakes do they have in the way poverty gets defined?\nWhere do they stand in relation to these recommendations?\nHow do they justify their stance?\n\nAs a group, we will compare your findings in order to consider the role of social advocacy in shaping the definitions underpinning this data. We will also consider stakeholder groups that might not be represented on Regulations.gov.\n\n\nPart 3: Deconstructive Reading\nCreate a hypothetical “profiles” for two individuals that this dataset eclipses. Try and bring these individuals to life, telling us about them. Why is it that those individuals go uncounted? Indicate specific consequences that may result from be uncounted. Also indicate some benefits to uncounted in this data.\n\n\nPart 4: Analyzing Categories\nWhen working with this dataset last week, you may have been surprised regarding how race and ethnicity were subdivided in the dataset. Demographic categories used in most federal government data collection programs in the U.S. are standardized by the Office of Management and Budget. These standards were last revised in 1997, but proposals to change them were made in 2016 and generated a great deal of public commentary on Regulations.gov.\nIn your groups, check out this site, which documents how racial categorization has changed in the census since 1790. Note what surprises you the most.\nAfter this, check out what was proposed in 2016 regarding standards for collecting data on race and ethnicity, and read through some of the public comments. What were some rationales for changing the standards, and what were some rationales for maintaining the current standards? What social groups had stakes in these decisions, and how did they advocate?"
